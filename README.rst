Dickel
======

* Dickel is a web framework that came about purely out of my desire to learn wsgi
* The name came from the fact that only someone drinking something like George Dickel
  would decided to create yet another web framework. The funny thing is that it 
  actually works.

* See the sampleapp directory for a simple wsgi application that runs with Dickel
Requirements
------------
* SqlAlchemy.
* WebOb for the Request and Response.
* Beaker for the session middleware.
