Dickel
======

* Dickel is a micro framework that came about purely out of my desire to learn wsgi
* The name came from the fact that only someone drinking something like George Dickel
  would decide to create yet another web framework.
* See the sampleapp directory for a simple wsgi application that runs with Dickel

Dependencies
------------
* webob - because Ian Bicking did a better job.
