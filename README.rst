Dickel
======

* Dickel is a web framework that came about purely out of my desire to learn wsgi
* The name came from the fact that only someone drinking something like George Dickel
  would decide to create yet another web framework.
* See the sampleapp directory for a simple wsgi application that runs with Dickel

Requirements
------------
* None
